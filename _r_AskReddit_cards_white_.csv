"Being suicidally depressed and alone"
Despair
"Failing an exam you studied hard for."
"Feeling completely alone, not being able to sleep, not wanting to even begin to deal with the new day."
"Having no friends at all"
"Holding your dog while the vet puts him to sleep."
"If you could instantly become the world's leading expert on one thing, what would it be?"
"Knowing that you're going to die soon and your life has been a tedious waste of time."
"Knowing you've fucked something up or hurt someone you care about, and knowing there's nothing you can do to fix it."
Loneliness
"Looking down and not seeing your penis"
"man, its completely bonkers that ______ hasn't been invented yet."
"Outliving your children."
"Pouring a bowl of cereal and then realizing you don't have milk."
Purposelessness.
"Taking a loved one to the airport not knowing when you'll see them again."
"That feeling when you forgot your delicious leftovers at the restaurant."
"The first time you open the front door immediately after your dog dies."
"Total loneliness."
"Watching your children starve"
"What do you need to vent about?"
"Witnessing suffering."
"Would you vote for a ______ president?"
